# WorldMetro-Tableau

The data has been sourced from Kaggle and used Tableau to create an interactive dashboard that summarizes the metro details of different countries.

On exploring USA data, I identified that the New York City subway has the highest number of stations (424), followed by Chicago L (145). The New York City subway covers the largest distance (248 mi), followed by Washington Metro (128 mi). Also, BART and Washington Metros have been expanded in the last 5 years.

On a global level, China has the largest number of customers with 20.71 billion annual riders.
